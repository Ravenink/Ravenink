## Hey, I'm Luis de la Torre!

<img align='right' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ravenink/Ravenink/master/images/me.jpg' width='200"'>

> I am a university teacher in UNED (for those of you who do not know, that's the Spanish Open University) and co-Founder of Nebulous Systems.

I started developing open source code while doing my Ph.D. in Computer Science, creating plugins for Moodle.

Since then, I have worked on integrating virtual and remote HTML5 online labs into Moodle and other Learning Management Systems, connecting HTML5 apps with real devices through LabVIEW, Matlab/Simulink, Python and Arduino.

Nebulous Systems is a spin-off company from the University of Huelva we funded to develop and commercialize a cloud IoT platform to enable the remote operation and use of lab equipment, either with research or educational purposes.
